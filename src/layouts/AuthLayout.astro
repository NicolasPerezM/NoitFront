<!--
  This is an Astro layout component, specifically designed for authentication-related pages
  (e.g., login, registration, password reset).
  Layout components in Astro are used to define the common structure for a set of pages.
-->
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="es"> <!-- Sets the language of the document to Spanish. -->
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8"> <!-- Specifies the character encoding for the document (UTF-8 is recommended). -->
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"> <!-- Configures the viewport for responsive design. -->
    <title>Document</title> <!-- Default document title. This should ideally be replaced by a dynamic title from the page using this layout. -->
    <!--
      It's common to include other <head> elements here, such as:
      - <link rel="stylesheet" href="/styles/global.css"> for global styles.
      - <link rel="icon" type="image/svg+xml" href="/favicon.svg"> for the favicon.
      - SEO-related meta tags (description, keywords, etc.).
      - Potentially, a <slot name="head" /> for page-specific head content.
    -->
</head>
<body>
    <!--
      The <slot /> tag is a placeholder where the content of the Astro page
      that uses this layout will be injected. This is the main content area.
    -->
    <slot/>
    <!--
      The <ClientRouter /> component enables Astro's View Transitions.
      When navigating between pages that use this layout (or other layouts with ClientRouter),
      Astro will attempt to perform smooth, animated transitions instead of a full page reload.
      It should typically be placed at the end of the <body>.
    -->
    <ClientRouter/>
